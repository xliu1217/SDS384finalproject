# XAI4Adapt: Adaptive Explainable AI System

## Dataset

Bird 525 species on Kaggle

## Project Overview

XAI4Adapt is an adaptive explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) system designed to enhance the transparency and understandability of AI predictions. This project focuses on dynamically generating XAI explanations based on user-specific queries, using various techniques such as SHAP, LIME, counterfactual explanations, and more. The system is built using the "Birds 525 Species" dataset to demonstrate its capabilities in image classification tasks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Explanation Generation**: Tailors explanations according to user input.
- **Multiple XAI Techniques**: Integrates SHAP, LIME, counterfactuals, and other methods.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focuses on improving user trust and satisfaction through personalized explanations.
- **Interactive Chatbot Interface**: Allows users to interact and query the AI system in a conversational manner.
